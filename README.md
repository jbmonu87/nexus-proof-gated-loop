# Nexus Proof-Gated Loop (Curated Public Artifacts)

This repository is **not** the Nexus IOE codebase. It’s a **public portfolio of my build system**: how I orchestrate AI agents and engineering work into a loop that compounds progress instead of compounding chaos.

**Focus:** Plan → Build → Verify → Compound  
**Goal:** Make correctness legible and enforceable, even when development is fast.

## What this shows (quick)
- How I structure an AI-assisted workflow with clear roles (Planner / Builder / Verifier)
- How I define “what must be true” contracts before implementation
- How I gate progress on proofs (tests/oracles/contracts), not confidence
- How I keep refactors from turning into a junk drawer fire

## What this is not
- Not a runnable Nexus release
- Not a source dump
- Not a startup pitch deck

## Start here (5–10 minutes)
1) `docs/INTERVIEW_TOUR.md` — guided tour
2) `docs/BUILD_LOOP.md` — the loop and roles
3) `docs/VERIFICATION_STYLEGUIDE.md` — how verification stays deterministic
4) `docs/SANITIZED_EXCERPTS.md` — safe excerpts from internal contracts/invariants

## Tech stack (context, not a dependency promise)
The internal project uses tools like: Electron, Playwright (E2E), and native rendering engines (e.g., Konva/Tiptap patterns). This repo focuses on **the operating system** for building, not the full implementation.
