# Glossary

- **Atomic sprint:** one user-facing outcome + one proof.
- **Proof:** an automated check that verifies the outcome.
- **Oracle:** a fidelity check (often visual) that compares output to a baseline.
- **Invariant:** a rule that must always hold (UX or behavior).
- **Seam:** a stable debug surface used to make verification deterministic.
- **Verifier-gated:** progress is blocked unless verification passes.
