# Status (Honest Snapshot)

## Why this repo exists
This repository is a public portfolio of an AI-assisted build loop:
**Plan → Build → Verify → Compound**.

It is **not** the full Nexus IOE codebase. The full implementation is private and actively evolving.

## What’s included here
- Build loop definition and roles
- Verification philosophy (proof-gated progress)
- Public-safe architecture framing
- Sanitized excerpts from internal docs (edited to remove sensitive details)

## What’s intentionally not included
- Full source code
- Proprietary fixtures / corpora
- Anything that would weaken IP or security posture
